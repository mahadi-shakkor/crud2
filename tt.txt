--------ADD file in github
It looks like you're trying to push changes to GitHub, but you have some modified and untracked files that are not staged for commit. Here's how you can resolve the situation step by step:
git add ../git.txt
git add ../tt.txt
git status
git commit -m "Add git.txt and tt.txt with new changes"
git push origin newb:main
git push origin newb


### Steps to Stage and Commit Changes

1. **Stage the modified file**:
   - You have a modified file `../git.txt`. To stage it for commit, run the following command:
   
     ```bash
     git add ../git.txt
     ```

2. **Stage the untracked file**:
   - You also have an untracked file `../tt.txt`. To stage this file as well, run:
   
     ```bash
     git add ../tt.txt
     ```

3. **Check the status**:
   - After staging, you can check the status to ensure the files are added correctly:
   
     ```bash
     git status
     ```

     This should show both `git.txt` and `tt.txt` as staged for commit.

4. **Commit the changes**:
   - Once the files are staged, you need to commit them with a meaningful message:
   
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Add git.txt and tt.txt with new changes"
     ```

5. **Push the changes to the remote repository**:
   - After committing the changes, you can push them to the `main` branch on GitHub:
   
     ```bash
     git push origin newb:main
     ```

### Explanation:
- `git add <file>` stages the file to be committed.
- `git commit -m "<message>"` commits the staged changes with a description.
- `git push origin <branch>:<remote>` pushes the changes to the remote repository (in this case, pushing from `newb` to `main`).

If the `newb` branch doesnâ€™t exist remotely, you may need to create a new branch or push it as a new branch by running:

```bash
git push origin newb
```
